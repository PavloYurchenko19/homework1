        <p>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective had a long and bizarre road to the big screen. Producers considered everybody from
            Rick Moranis to Whoopi Goldberg for the lead role, eventually going with Jim Carrey, who was then
            universally known as "the white guy from In Living Color." He took the film on the condition that he could
            re-write the script with his team, and in a short time period they made the movie incredibly bizarre and
            even added in a surprise kicker straight out of The Crying Game. Hollywood was absolutely stunned when it
            grossed $107 million on a mere $15 million budget. Nobody ever thought of Jim Carrey as "the white guy from
            In Living Color" again. </p>
